# A Simple Implementation of DEtection TRansformer(DETR)
Facekbook AI recently released the paper on [End-to-end object detection with Transformers](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers). As compared to the generic Detection algorithms, they have been able to successfully integrate Transformers as a central building block in the detection pipeline. This is merely a simple implementation of the model and it gives pretty good resuits !! 

## Dependencies:
1. [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
2. [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
4. [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
5. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)

## Usage:
Run ***python detr_fb.py*** and get the results. I randomly pulled out some images from google. :smile:
