# A Simple Implementation of DEtection TRansformer(DETR)
Facekbook AI recently released the paper on [End-to-end object detection with Transformers](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers). As compared to the generic Detection algorithms, they have been able to successfully integrate Transformers as a central building block in the detection pipeline. This is merely a simple implementation of the model and it gives pretty good resuits !!
